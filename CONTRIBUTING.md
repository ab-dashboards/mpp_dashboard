# Contributing

## Workflow
- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Keep changes focused and logically grouped.
- Run tests and lint before opening a PR.

## Code standards
- Python code should pass `ruff check`.
- Add tests for deterministic logic when changing parsing/date/queue behavior.
- Keep secrets out of code and commit history.

## Pull requests
- Use clear title and summary.
- Include test evidence.
- Update docs when behavior or configuration changes.
